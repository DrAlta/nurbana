Method 1:
- Modelview handles following:
  - Object Creation new main
  - Object Duplication main -> main
  - Backup of Objects all main -> new backup
  - Reset (Duplication) backup -> main
- New function to swap between Main and Backup list

- What about doing a linked list of Object List's for multi-level undo
  functionality?
  - Will that be handled by Modelview as well?

-----------------------------------------------------------
Method 2:
- Move all functions from Object_Manager to a higher level Class
  - Class will include: Object_Manager
  - Object_Manager will pass back pointer to desired ObjectNode

- New class will contain all necessary functions
**- Make sure we would have access to change objects from this new class...

- From this new class manage:
  - Object Creation
  - Object Duplication
  - Object Backup
  - Object Reset

- Inside new class have:
  - (2) instances of Object Manager for Main and Backup lists
  - new struct for a list of Object Lists for multi-level undo
